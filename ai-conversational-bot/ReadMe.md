# Introduction
This is a simple flask (a python based micro web-framework) web-application which exposes a POST action against an end-point "/converse" to evaluate a text response against the provided sentence in a JSON format.

- This REST end-point is essentially an AI Conversational which Bot classifies user input to recognize intent which is resolved by Machine Learning implemented with Keras having TensorFlow as backend.<br/><br/>
  Keras Deep Learning Library is used to build a classification model.<br/>Keras runs training on top of TensorFlow backend.<br/><br/>
  Lancaster Stemming Library (from nltk - Natural Language Tool-Kit) is used to collapse distinct word forms.<br/><br/>
  Chatbot Intents and Patterns to learn are defined in a plain JSON file. There is no need to have a huge vocabulary since it is a POC and very domain-specific. 
  conversations-model.py builds Classification Model using the small vocabulary defined in "intents.json".<br/>
  
- Conversational Context is maintained in Slack Bot backed by a separate Spring Boot Application.
